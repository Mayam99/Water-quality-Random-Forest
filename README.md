Introduction

Water Quality Dataset Overview

Water is essential for life, and its quality is crucial for health, ecosystems, and the economy. The Water Quality Dataset from Kaggle provides valuable data for analyzing and classifying the quality of water. This dataset is instrumental for researchers, data scientists, and environmentalists in developing models to predict and improve water quality.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of various chemical parameters tested in water samples to classify the quality of the water. These parameters include pH level, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity. Each parameter provides insights into different aspects of water quality, and their collective analysis helps in determining whether the water is safe for consumption and other uses.

Content

What's inside is more than just rows and columns. You can see water ingredients listed as column names.

Description

All attributes are numeric variables and they are listed bellow:

* aluminium - dangerous if greater than 2.8
* ammonia - dangerous if greater than 32.5
* arsenic - dangerous if greater than 0.01
* barium - dangerous if greater than 2
* cadmium - dangerous if greater than 0.005
* chloramine - dangerous if greater than 4
* chromium - dangerous if greater than 0.1
* copper - dangerous if greater than 1.3
* flouride - dangerous if greater than 1.5
* bacteria - dangerous if greater than 0
* viruses - dangerous if greater than 0
* lead - dangerous if greater than 0.015
* nitrates - dangerous if greater than 10
* nitrites - dangerous if greater than 1
* mercury - dangerous if greater than 0.002
* perchlorate - dangerous if greater than 56
* radium - dangerous if greater than 5
* selenium - dangerous if greater than 0.5
* silver - dangerous if greater than 0.1
* uranium - dangerous if greater than 0.3

Target Variable:

* is_safe - class attribute {0 - not safe, 1 - safe}

Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to classify water samples as potable or non-potable based on the given chemical properties. By employing machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately determine water quality, aiding in the management and treatment of water resources.

Applications

Public Health: Ensuring safe drinking water and preventing waterborne diseases.

Environmental Monitoring: Assessing the impact of pollution on water bodies.

Water Treatment: Optimizing water purification processes.

Policy Making: Informing regulations and standards for water quality.

Conclusion

By understanding and analyzing the Water Quality Dataset, we can make significant strides in improving water safety and quality. This notebook will guide you through the steps of preprocessing the data, exploring machine learning model, and evaluating their performance in classifying water quality.
